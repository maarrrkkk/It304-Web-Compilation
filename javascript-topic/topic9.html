            <h3>JS Objects</h3>
            <p>


                In JavaScript, functions are first-class objects, which means they can be treated like any other object.
                This characteristic allows for powerful programming techniques and patterns. Let's discuss and explain
                some important aspects of function objects:
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Creation and Declaration</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Functions can be created in several ways, including function declarations, function
                            expressions, and arrow functions.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Once created, a function becomes an object and can be assigned to variables, passed as
                            arguments to other functions, returned from functions, and stored in data structures like
                            arrays and objects.
                        </li>

                    </ul>
                </li>
                <h4>Example Code:</h4>
                <div class="pre-container">
                    <pre>
// Function declaration
function greet(name) {
    return "Hello, " + name + "!";
}

// Function expression
var add = function(a, b) {
    return a + b;
};

// Arrow function
var subtract = (a, b) => a - b;

               
                    </pre>
                </div>

                <li>
                    <strong>Function Properties</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Like any object, functions can have properties. They can be added, modified, or deleted
                            dynamically.</li>

                    </ul>
                </li>
                <h4>Example Code:</h4>
                <div class="pre-container">
                    <pre>
// Adding a property to a function object
greet.language = "English";
console.log(greet.language); // Output: English

                    </pre>
                </div>

                <li>
                    <strong>Function Methods</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Functions in JavaScript are objects of the built-in Function constructor, which provides
                            methods for working with functions.</li>
                        <li>For example, the apply() and call() methods allow you to call a function with a specified
                            this value and arguments.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <h4>Example Code:</h4>
                <div class="pre-container">
                    <pre>
function introduce() {
    console.log("My name is " + this.name + ".");
}

var person = {
    name: "Alice"
};

introduce.call(person); // Output: My name is Alice.

         
                    </pre>
                </div>

                <li>
                    <strong>Higher-Order Functions</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Functions that can accept other functions as arguments or return functions are known as
                            higher-order functions.
                        </li>
                        <li>This enables powerful functional programming paradigms, such as map, filter, reduce, and
                            more.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <h4>Example Code:</h4>
                <div class="pre-container">
                    <pre>
function map(arr, fn) {
    var result = [];
    for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        result.push(fn(arr[i]));
    }
    return result;
}

var numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
var doubled = map(numbers, function(num) {
    return num * 2;
});
console.log(doubled); // Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
    
                    </pre>
                </div>

                <li>
                    <strong>Closures</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Functions in JavaScript have access to the variables defined in their outer scope, even
                            after the outer function has finished executing. This is known as a closure.</li>
                        <li>Closures are a powerful feature that allows for maintaining state and creating private
                            variables.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <h4>Example Code:</h4>
                <div class="pre-container">
                    <pre>
function createCounter() {
    var count = 0;
    return function() {
        return ++count;
    };
}

var counter = createCounter();
console.log(counter()); // Output: 1
console.log(counter()); // Output: 2

   
                    </pre>
                </div>



            </ol>

            <p>
                Understanding functions as objects in JavaScript opens up a wide range of possibilities for creating
                flexible, reusable, and expressive code. By leveraging their properties, methods, and capabilities,
                developers can employ advanced programming techniques and patterns to build robust and scalable
                applications.
