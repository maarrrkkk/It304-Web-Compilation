            <ol>
                <li><strong>Single-line Comments</strong>:Single-line comments begin with // and continue until the end
                    of the line. They are commonly used for short comments or annotations on a single line of code.
                </li>
                <h4>Example Code:</h4>
                <div class="pre-container">
                    <pre>
                        // This is a single-line comment
                        var x = 5; // Assigning the value 5 to the variable x
                        
                    </pre>
                </div>
